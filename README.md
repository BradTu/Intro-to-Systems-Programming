All of the following assignments build off of eachother. Some of the code was provided by Ben Jones and Nathan Sturtevant.

## Homework2

Creates a 64 bit (4 * 4 * 4) 3D voxel shape

## Homework3

This assignment creates an .stl file that represents the 64 bit model. Code for this assignment written in VoxelModel.cpp on lines 142-316.

## Homework4

This assignment uses heap memory and structs. The assignment code written in the voxelModel.hpp and voxelModel.cpp.

## Homework5

This assignment involves class encapsulation. The assignment code written all is all of the BitVector classes and the VoxelShape.cpp from lines 6-62, 131-134, 219-292.

## Homework7

This assignment parrallelizes the code for extracting the surface of the shape. The assignment code is in SurfaceExtraction.cpp lines 108-339.
